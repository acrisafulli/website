1.)5 key definitions
1. Sqrt of -4 is sort of 4 and sort of -1
2. Sqrt of -1 is “i”
3. Imaginary numbers and real numbers make the complex number system
4. Complex numbers are basically numbers existing on a third dimensional plane
5. When adding invisible numbers treat them like variables (don’t add invisible to real)
6. Real number comes first, imaginary after
7. When multiplying numbers you can multiply real and invisible with each other
8. i squared is the same as -1
9. Conjugate is when you multiply something against itself but change the sign INBETWEEN
10. “i” is a radical so when dividing you need to make it “i” squared
11. Use the imaginary plane to help with absolute value (it works the same as normal.
12. The absolute value of an imaginary number is a real number
13. When its a binomial use the graph draw a line to zero from the point, then use Pythagorean
14. MOD/clock 4
15. The pattern in i -1 -i 1 and then repeat
16. You can divide and exponent by 4 and the remainder helps you find the answer
