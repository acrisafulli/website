  <h1>What solution are we using to the problem presented in the chapter of
    <q>finding yourself a hosting company</q>?
    What are the advantages and disadvantages of our solution? What
    alternatives could we have used, and which alternative
    did we use earlier in the year?</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>We are using github instead which is free and easy to learn but you don't
    get to choose the server software and don't own the infrastructure. Earlier
  in the year we connected to a server instead of using github.</h2>

  <h1>A few of our enterprising classmates have taken the initiative to register
    their own domain name.See if you can find these classmates and ask them how
    they did it.What is the process involved? Where can you go to register a
    domain name?</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>To register a domain name you need to choose/find a place to register
    it,choose and finalize your domain name, pick a suffix, purchase the domain
  name and add domain ID protection. Some places to register are Namecheap,
  Domain.com and google domains.</h2>

  <h1>Compare the workflow presented in the book (which is a bit old at this
    point) with the one we use. How are they different? How are they
    similar?</h1>
  <br>
  <h2> In the old workflow you log in to an FTP and transfer your files yo a
    directory there. With the new workflow we use git add git commit git push to
  put/update our files onto github.FTP was less secure and less flexible than
  github but in both you were transferring files to something.</h2>
