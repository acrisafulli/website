  Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
  <ol>
    <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
    <li> Magic City,ID</li>
    <li> Bountiful, UT,</li>
    <li> Last Chance, CO,</li>
    <li> Why, AZ</li>
    <li> Truth or Consequences, NM.</li>
    </ol>

My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
<ul>
  <li>cell phone</li>
  <li>iPod</li>
  <li>digital camera</li> <li> protein bar</li>
</ul>
Just the essentials. As
Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>

  <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:</p>
<blockquote>
Passing cars,
When you can't see,
May get you,
A glimpse,
Of eternity.
</blockquote>
<p>I definitely won't be passing any cars. </p>
