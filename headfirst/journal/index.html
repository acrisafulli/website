  Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way: Walla Walla, WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO, Why, AZ and Truth or Consequences, NM.

  My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and
  ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway,I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with
  me: cell phone, iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials.
  As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one
    Segway.</q> </p>
